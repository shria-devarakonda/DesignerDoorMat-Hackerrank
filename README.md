# DesignerDoorMat-Hackerrank
My solution for the hackerrank designer doormat problem. 
Wanted to keep this on here for people who might need help/look at it myself later to feel proud for writing some basic ass python

To do here,

Enter an odd number bigger than 5, and the number that is triple it (eg, 5 15 or 9 27) which are the height and width. In the output you will be given a designer welcome mat as per the specifications you mentioned (x 3x).

I figured this solution out myself and it took an embarassing amount of time to code, but math is always fun to get lost into.
